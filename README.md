**Dont forget to cut the center trace on the stepper motor as shown in the youtube video**

## File setup

Fill out the entire USER CONFIGURATION section of the code.

You should leave "STEPS_TO_CLOSE" at 12 to start with.  It can be adjusted for your specific blinds

## Home Assistant YAML

Replace "BlindsMCU" with your MQTT_CLIENT_ID if you changed it in the file setup

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Motorized Blinds"
    command_topic: "BlindsMCU/blindsCommand"
    set_position_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionCommand"
    position_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionState"
    state_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionState"
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    position_open: 0
    position_closed: 12
  ```

### NodeMCU (Arduino) Info

MAC Address of 1st NodeMCU:  84:CC:A8:82:DE:0A

**Attention!** Make sure you are using a micro-USB cable that supports _*data*_ as well as power!

Note that there are comm port issues with Big Sur that impact Arduino.  For more info see:
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/7763 and the fix in https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=702144.0.

From the Amazon.com product description...

Product description:
ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor.

Instruction & Steps of How to Use:

1. Download the Arduino IDE, the latest version.
2. Install the IDE
3. Set up your Arduino IDE as: Go to File->Preferences and copy the URL below to get the ESP board manager extensions: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json Placing the http:// before the URL lets the Arduino IDE use it...otherwise it gives you a protocol error.
4. Go to Tools > Board > Board Manager> Type "esp8266" and download the Community esp8266 and install.
5. Set up your chip as:
Tools -> Board -> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
Tools -> Flash Size -> 4M (3M SPIFFS)
Tools -> CPU Frequency -> 80 Mhz
Tools -> Upload Speed -> 921600
Tools-->Port--> (whatever it is)
6. Download and run the 32 bit flasher exe at Github(Search for nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/ at Github) github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/Win32/Release Or download and run the 64 bit flasher exe at: github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/Win64/Release
7. In Arduino IDE, look for the old fashioned Blink program. Load, compile and upload.
8. Go to FILE> EXAMPLES> ESP8266> BLINK, it will start blinking.

# Alexa ONLY Control... the GOOD Stuff

  - Lifted from https://github.com/thehookup/Motorized_MQTT_Blinds/releases/tag/Alexa_No_Hub

## Alexa Only with WiFi Manager

@thehookup thehookup released this on Apr 11, 2019 Â· 10 commits to master since this release

This release uses Amazon Alexa local control and WiFi Manager to configure and control your blinds. No other hub or device (other than a wifi router) is required for this version and there is no MQTT control.

This is a pre-compiled bin file to upload to a NodeMCU using the ESPEasy flashing tool (instructions below).

  Install Instructions:

      Download the ESPEasy Flashing tool here: https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/releases/
      Extract the zip file from the above link to your computer
      Download the .bin file for this release and place it in the same folder as the ESPEasy flashing tool.
      Plug in your NodeMCU using a USB Cable
      Run FlashESP8266.exe
      Select this bin file (Alexa_Only_Blinds.bin) under the firmware dropdown and press "Flash"

  Setup Instructions:

      Connect to the "Blinds Setup" wifi access point that is being broadcast by your NodeMCU
      Enter your WiFi SSID and Password
      Enter the number of rotations required for your blinds to fully open/close (12 Recommended)
      Press save and wire your blinds as shown in the wiring diagram on the main page of this repository.

  **If you mess up your settings you can connect a wire between GND and D1 to clear the saved settings on the NodeMCU.
  If you have issues with discovery please try the "Blinds_CONFIGURE_Portal_Alexa_Core_2.3.bin" file
